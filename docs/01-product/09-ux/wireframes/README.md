# Wireframes

This folder contains low-fidelity wireframes for the Unified Restaurant Ordering Platform. Wireframes are used to visualize layout, navigation, and user flows before detailed design and development.

## How to Use
- Review each wireframe with stakeholders and the development team.
- Update wireframes based on feedback before moving to high-fidelity mockups.
- Link relevant wireframes in user stories and sprint plans for reference.

## Key Screens to Include
- Tenant Signup & Login
- Onboarding Wizard
- Menu Management (CRUD)
- Table & QR Management
- Customer Menu (QR Scan)
- Cart & Checkout
- Payment Flow
- Kitchen Display System (KDS)
- Analytics Dashboard
- Staff Management

## File Naming Convention
- `01-signup.png` or `01-signup.pdf` (use sequential numbers for ordering)
- Add a short description in the filename if needed

## Tools
- Balsamiq, Figma, Whimsical, or hand-drawn scans

## Multilingual & Localization Requirement

All wireframes and user stories must support multilingual interfaces. The platform should allow users to select their preferred language (e.g., English, Vietnamese, etc.) at login or in profile/settings. All UI text, labels, and error messages must be translatable. Wireframes should visually indicate language selection controls and consider text expansion for different languages.

- Add a language selector to login, signup, and profile management screens.
- Ensure menu, cart, and checkout screens can display content in multiple languages.
- Indicate in wireframes where translations or locale-specific content will appear.

Add new wireframes to this folder and update this README as needed.
